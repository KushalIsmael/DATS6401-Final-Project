# Variance in PPP Loans
## Description
This was the final project for George Washington University's DATS 6401 - Visualization of Complex Data course. The visualizations in this project show how PPP Loans under $150 thousand dollars were distributed by state. You will see the difference in PPP loans by population, tax paid, and political party. Finally you can use a dashboard to see the PPP loans for your state.

The data was cleaned and combined using Python. All visualizations were created using Tableau Desktop and then uploaded to Tableau Public. The visualization storyboard was embedded into a Bootstrap website template hosted on GitHub pages.
